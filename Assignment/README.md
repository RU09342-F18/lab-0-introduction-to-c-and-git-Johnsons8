# Lab 0
This is a simple implementation of different math functions

## Header (math.h)
math.h sets up the inputs and output of the math function. The inputs of the function are integers 'num1' and 'num2' which are whole number integers, and then the other input is an operator under the name of 'Operator' using the data type char, which is a character in the ASCII keyboard.

## Implementation (math.c)
The implementation of the math function implementing the header (math.h).....
